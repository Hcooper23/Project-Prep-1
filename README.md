# Group Project: Team Agreement
The first step in project planning is establishing a Team Agreement. This will be used as the guideline for how your team will collaborate during project week.

Projects are stressful, and can ignite emotions that otherwise wouldn’t be a problem. It’s important that the safety and security of the group comes first, and that an agreement is in place to establish expectations and accountability among the whole group.

## Planning
Schedule a 1-hour meeting for your entire project team.

Use this time to review the Team Agreement requirements below, and establish consensus on how to handle each requirement.

## Deliverable
Start a public-facing GitHub markdown file, and include the following components in your team agreement submission.

## Cooperation Plan

Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

Describe at least:

- What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
Kenya- Strengths will be asking of question to allow for maximum productive inside of the team for us all to utilize good thinking and have positive thinking about how to resolve issues. 
Juan- I’m comfortable with CSS Grid, JS Objects, learning something new and breaking down a problem to manageable pieces
Isabel- Adaptability, organization, reliability
Ben- Attention to detail, problem solving, team player
Hayden- Utilization of prior experience inside of project management to allow for a proper flow and progression of the project and utilization of a team flow method that has set goals, deadlines, and approval of the work done for each day.

- How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
Kenya-By contributing to the team as much as possible and requesting assistance when needed. 
Juan- Make myself open to the team when dealing with objects or issues I may run into as well taking the lead in areas I feel comfortable in. 
Isabel- By being able to adjust to new conditions and being available for any team members at any given time.
Ben- Asking questions and digging into the specifics of the projects to benefit the efficiency as well being open to the criticisms and improvements brought forward by the team. 
Hayden- Lead and set goals for the team and allow for others to seek me out when needed to advance workflow and allow for a successful team implementation. 

- In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
Kenya- Better Time Management
Juan- Professional competencies I would like to develop are with Java Script specially with DOM manipulation, Objects, reading and writing to local storage, and using multi dimensional arrays. With CSS would be animations and locking items to one part of a page.
Isabel- Focus on teamwork competency, I have past experience working on a team but not with quick of a turn around inside of a project 
Ben- Working through the git hub process in a team environment.
Hayden- Commination, Team resolution, and leadership 

- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
    - NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.

## Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

Describe at least:

- What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
Bring a team meeting together and have a discussion on the issues that are at hand currently.

- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
To allow for everyone to utilize there strengths in this project so we can maximum efficiency and understand we are all working for a common goal. 

- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
Bring into a discussion and verify we all feel as a team that someone is not holding up there end of the project and then have a discussion with that individuals to allow for all of us to hear how we can be better team members and help them resolve any issues they may be having. 

- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
After two issue of the same type and two different team discussion we will then raise the issue up to higher level as needed.

Will allow everyone to communicate and vote upon bigger over arching issue that effect everyone and will allow for freedom of expression and team voting for the project.

## Work Plan

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

    - NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

Describe at least:

- How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
Breaking down based on the following factors knowledge, experience, and comfortbalilty. Now this can allow for everyone to one achieve something they fill great at doing and as well allow for more time to be spent learning from other around us. There will be a review at the start of the day and at lunch as well end of day to see progress as well anytime during the day we do pull reviews this will also be a good time to do a project status check as well. 

- What project management tool will be used?
To-do/ time line sets with projection timeline/ deadlines. 

## Presentation Deck

Make a single copy of the Presentation Deck Template. Share your copy will all team members, so everyone is working from the same file.

Link to the shared doc in your project plan.

## Schedule your practice session

Work with your instructor to pre-schedule an date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.

Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:

- Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.
- When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the “audience” / camera.
- Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel … “Your smiles can be heard over the phone”

## Git Process

Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

Describe at least:

- What components of your project will live on GitHub?
All components relative to the project. The Git ignore document will have files removed that are not relevant to the project.

- How will you share the repository with your teammates?
Repository will be shared via the link on the team. Only one person will be allowed to merge all of the pull requests for the team after review by at least two people. Each team member will create branches locally and request to pull the request.

- What is your Git flow?
Git flow will be ACP by each team member and each team member will generate a pull request to be managed by one person on the team.

- Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
    - How many people must review a PR?
    Only the people who submit the PR will have to attend everyone else will be invited but not required to participate.
    - Who merges PRs?
    Hayden Cooper will be responsible to merge all of the PRs.

    We will merge every single hour after break as needed for bigger code days and at a minimum we will do at least 2 merges and pulls everyday. 
    - How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
    Slack message will be sent out and response will have to be required to understand who will be coming or who will not be coming. From time of invitation there will be a 30-minute timer where the meeting has to begin. Once all of the pull requests have been completed a message will be sent out to the team to pull from main in order to have the latest working copy of the code repo.
